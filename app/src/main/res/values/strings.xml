    <string name="para_1">"The HEALTH4THEWORLD STROKE HOPE APP is a free of cost educational tool to spread knowledge about stroke risk factors, secondary prevention, post stroke mobility &amp; exercise education and speech strategies.  It has been created by Health4TheWorld which is a non profit organization inspired by the unmet medical needs worldwide. The mission of the organization is solving health inequities through innovation &amp; technology and bringing smiles around the world. Please learn more about us at health4theworld.org."</string>
    <string name="para_2">With an estimated incidence of 16.9 million and a prevalence of 33 million according to the World Health Organization, stroke is a dominant diseased entity in the category of cardiovascular diseases, and is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. The global burden of stroke falls disproportionately on low and middle-income countries, prompting us to improve global health educational outreach. We hope that this stroke educational app will be helpful.</string>
    <string name="app_features">The app has several features that we hope you will find useful!</string>
    <string name="app_features_1">• Stroke Educational Content – Information on causes and risk factors of stroke with guidelines from the American Stroke Association, American Heart Association, evidence based articles and other healthcare sources. It is good to remember that these are general educational tips and not recommendations for clinical care. Both the patient and trained health professionals should sit together to work on a personalized prevention regimen for stroke.</string>
    <string name="app_features_2">• Video Animation and Exercise Tips for Stroke Recovery –Education for exercise and rehabilitation after stroke has been summarized by Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation experts from Stanford, University of California, San Francisco and University of Southern California. The exercises here are general and are intended to serve as educational guide not as medical advice.  These should be done with an occupational therapist and/or physical therapist, which can help with the correct technique and designing a regimen that will benefit a stroke patient best. A caregiver should always be present to help. These are divided into strengthening, stretching and functional mobility. Please advise your patients about the correct technique, frequency and regimen of these exercises.</string>
    <string name="app_features_3">• Reminders for Medications and Appointments: Medication and Appointment compliance is a major issue and this tool is hopefully helpful!  Please set reminders for your patients if possible.</string>
    <string name="app_features_4">• Speech Strategies After Stroke: The press button voice output can help with very basic communication. The aim is to translate these to different languages so health professions and patients in remote parts of the world who lack health access can benefit from these.</string>

    <string name="faq_line1">WHAT IS A STROKE?</string>
    <string name="faq_line2">In a stroke, the blood supply to a particular part of the brain is blocked or a blood vessel that supplies a part of the brain bursts. This results in cell death in the affected part of the brain. This may result in temporary or permanent loss of function in one or more part(s) of the body.</string>
    <string name="faq_line11">WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU THINK SOMEONE IS HAVING A STROKE?</string>
    <string name="faq_line12">Call for professional medical help (doctor or nurse) immediately.</string>
    <string name="faq_line13">WHY DO YOU NEED TO ACT QUICKLY?</string>

    <string name="home_mod_line0">Because patients might experience limited mobility, it’s important to modify your home so that it is safe and accessible.</string>
    <string name="home_mod_line1">Bedroom</string>
    <string name="home_mod_line2">• Bedroom accessibility can be improved by moving items so that the door opens fully; widen doorways; reverse hinges so that door opens outwards instead of inwards. If a bed needs to be up against a wall, it should be oriented such that the patient’s affected side (weak side) is closer to the wall, so the strong side can assist the patient getting out of bed.</string>
    <string name="home_mod_line3">Bath</string>
    <string name="home_mod_line4">• Bathrooms can be made more accessible to wheelchairs by widening the doorway.</string>
    <string name="home_mod_line5">• Toilet seats can be raised to make it less challenging in getting to and from the toilet: a toilet elevator that mounts between the floor and toilet; a seat elevator that attaches to the bowl and raises the seat; installing toilet rails/grab bars to improve support for mobility.</string>
    <string name="home_mod_line8">General:</string>
    <string name="home_mod_line9">• Eliminate rugs that can easily move to avoid trips and falls.</string>
